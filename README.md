# CustomPullToRefreshControl

Based off Fabio Ritrovato's ODRefreshControl.

### Properties:

<pre>
@property (nonatomic, assign) UIActivityIndicatorViewStyle activityIndicatorViewStyle;
@property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *activityIndicatorViewColor; // iOS5 or more
@property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *tintColor;
@property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *strokeColor
@property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *shadowColor

@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL drawDiskWhenPulling
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL enableDiskDripEffect
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL stickToTopWhenRefreshing
@property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL scrollUpToCancel

/** Refresh animation on custom pullView */
@property (nonatomic, assign) CustomPullToRefreshStyle refreshStyle;
@property (nonatomic, assign) CustomPullToRefreshEasing refreshEasing;
</pre>


#### Enums

<pre>
// Enum for refresh style animation on pullView
typedef enum {
	CustomPullToRefreshNone,
	CustomPullToRefreshSpin,
	CustomPullToRefreshRotate,
} CustomPullToRefreshStyle;

// Enum for animation easing on pullView
typedef enum {
	CustomPullToRefreshLinear,
	CustomPullToRefreshMomentum,
	CustomPullToRefreshContinuous
} CustomPullToRefreshEasing;
</pre>


### Added features:

 * Custom stroke & shadow colors.
 * Can turn on or off the drippy-slimey effect.
 * Can cancel refresh by scrolling back to rest position for user-defined time,
   and will emit a UIControlEventTouchCancel action for targets to listen to.
 * Can position the refreshing activity indicator / custom view to top of screen
   or top of scrollView.
 * Custom ImageView in place of arrow, which you can animate using custom styles.
 * Custom animation styles using linear and momentum "easing", and spin or rotate transforms.
 * Added functionality to reposition if scrollview gets scrolled horizontally.

#### Known Issues:

 * You can't use the Rotate style animation with the drippy-slimey effect on.
 * You can only use the custon animation styles on a custon imageview.
 * It looks like if you set this on a regular UIScrollView and enable paging, the activity indicator doesn't stay at the top. Working on this.

## CustomPullToRefresh

![Screenshot](http://www.orangeinaday.com/img/ODRefreshControl.jpg "ODRefresh")

CustomPullToRefresh is a "pull down to refresh" control for UIScrollView, like the one Apple introduced in iOS6, but available to anyone from iOS4 and up.

### Installation

* Drag the CustomPullToRefresh folder into your project.
* Add the *QuartzCore* framework to your project.
* #import "CustomPullToRefresh.h"

#### Adding a refresh control to your table view

<pre>
CustomPullToRefresh *refreshControl = [[CustomPullToRefresh alloc] initInScrollView:self.scrollView];
</pre>

To know when the refresh operation has started, add an action method to the UIControlEventValueChanged event of the control

<pre>
[refreshControl addTarget:self action:@selector(dropViewDidBeginRefreshing:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventValueChanged];
</pre>

If youâ€™d like to programmatically start the refresh operation, use

<pre>
[refreshControl beginRefreshing];
</pre>

Remember to tell the control when the refresh operation has ended

<pre>
[refreshControl endRefreshing];
</pre>

#### Customization

The CustomPullToRefresh can be customized using the following properties:

<pre>
@property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *tintColor;
@property (nonatomic, assign) UIActivityIndicatorViewStyle activityIndicatorViewStyle;
@property (nonatomic, strong) UIColor *activityIndicatorViewColor; // iOS5 or more
</pre>
